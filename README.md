# Stock-Analysis Overview

## Overview of Project: ##
Help our client (Steve) to analyze stock performance of a number of investments for which he has provided data. 


## Purpose: ##
Steve needs some help sorting through all the data on stocks he has to help identify particular stocks that would be good for his parents portfolio as he is looking to provide them with some investment recommendations.


## Results: ##

### Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018 ###
The stock performance overall in 2017 was much more positive than in 2018.  In 2017 only one stock TERP had negative returns (-7.2%) while all other stocks had returns between +8.9% and +199.4%.  In 2018 there were 2 stocks with positive returns (ENPH and RUN), however their returns in 2018 were lower than in 2017.

Daily volumes in 2018 versus 2017 were up overall +4.4%, however that differed between stocks with 7 of 12 stocks daily volume up while 5 were down.  ENPH and RUN both had a large increase in daily traded volumes in 2018, only one stock DQ had daily volume increase more, but return was negative -62.6% for DQ in 2018.

Its tough to pick stocks with only 2 years of data, and with not having additional information of factors that may impact the stock performance in the future.  However, even with our limited information, given the performance of ENPH and RUN over the 2 years, I would recommend Steve take a closer look at these stocks as potential investments for his parents.
